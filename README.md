# Deep voice 3 with World vocoder
This repository supports World vocoder for DV3.
There are modifications to Merlin code for extracting world features and synthesizing from them.
Details on how to modify Merlin and World codes are to be updated soon.
I wrote that documentation in Korean originally and it only needs to be translated into English then it's ready to go.
It won't take long.
Any requests or  questions are welcome.
